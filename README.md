# hyprvisor

**hyprvisor** is a **hypr**land version manager

</div>


I got tired of the hyprland 0.47.x branch being still broken 2 weeks after release, so I made this

### USAGE

Example Usages:

    hyprvisor install v0.46.2       # Install Hyprland 0.46.2


### INSTALLING

Build / install is handled with cargo.

Note that `hyprvisor` replaces your system install of `hyprland` and all its runtime dependencies.

### TODO

- [ ] `hyprvisor update`
- [ ] logging
- [ ] uninstall old versions before installing new ver
- [ ] `--dry` flag
